# Telegram Bot
This is my Telegram Bot that I made with the Python-Telegram-Bot library in Python.
The goal is to make a Telegram bot, that can manage everything in my house, from the networking to the SmartHome.
Currently it can check the uptime for important devices, run a ipscan with nmap, get the energy consumption of the house, turn of lights in different rooms and get the temperature for each room
